## 1. Getting Started


Firstly, install the code:
```
remotes::install_github(repo='EAVE-II/Serology-Analysis', subdir='eavehelpers')
```

If this doesn't work, and you have checked out all the code, you can install like so:
```
install.packages("<path to code>/eavehelpers", repos = NULL, type="source")
```
